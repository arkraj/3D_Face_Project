# 3D_Face_Project
**AI Enabled 3D Face generation from image and video**

This project aims to develop a system for generating realistic 3D models of human faces using MediaPipe's FaceMesh technology. The system takes input images or videos of faces and generates corresponding 3D models with realistic textures, lighting, and pose. These generated models can be used in a wide range of applications, such as virtual try-on, face recognition, drowsiness detection, face painting, avatar creation, and real-time streaming of avatars.
